🎮 **Pong Game – Setting Up the Main Screen**

### 🧱 **Goal**

Create the initial game window using Python's `turtle` module.

---

## 🧪 **Steps Taken**

1. **Imported `Screen` from the `turtle` module**

   ```python
   from turtle import Screen
   ```

2. **Created a screen object**

   ```python
   screen = Screen()
   ```

3. **Configured screen settings**

   * Background color: **black**
   * Width: **800 pixels**
   * Height: **600 pixels**
   * Title: `"Pong"`

4. **Kept the window open using**

   ```python
   screen.exitonclick()
   ```

   * Prevents the window from closing immediately after running the program.

---

## ✅ **Final Code:**

```python
from turtle import Screen

screen = Screen()
screen.bgcolor("black")
screen.setup(width=800, height=600)
screen.title("Pong")
screen.exitonclick()
```


1.Create a Paddle (Pong Game)
🧱 Goal

Build a paddle on the right side of the screen and make it respond to keyboard input (Up, Down).

🎨 Paddle Setup

Used turtle.Turtle() to create a square-shaped turtle.

Changed color to white and stretched size to make it 20x100 pixels using shapesize().

Disabled drawing with penup() and placed it at position (350, 0) using goto().

🎮 Keyboard Control

Enabled keyboard listening using screen.listen().

Defined go_up() and go_down() functions to move paddle by ±20 pixels vertically using paddle.ycor() and paddle.goto().

Bound "Up" and "Down" keys using screen.onkey().

🚫 Disable Auto Animation

Turned off screen’s automatic updates using screen.tracer(0).
